# Case-Study-How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success-

This is a personal project completed as a capstone project during Google Data Analytics Certification from Coursera. In this I have followed a roadmap explained in the course to completed the project. I have also uploaded a detailed report on my project work as well as a power point presentation to explain the goal of the project, findings and suggestions according to my findings for the needs of the project. I have also uploaded my Jupyter notebook where I have done most of the analysis work.
